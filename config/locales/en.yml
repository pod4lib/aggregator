        body_html: Data in the lake is available to any POD participant to extract and reuse. It is up to the POD participant to consume and reuse the data responsibly. Libraries that seek to use POD data for uses that exceed the "minimum standard for data reuse for data providers" guidelines should exercise caution and investigate whether restrictions may apply to their intended use. This may include informing POD data provider contacts of the intended use.
